<p>I had chosen this stream because I have a keen interest towards computers snd machines from my childhood. A lot of members in my family whom I admire are at reputed position through choosing
  this field as a career. I am also attracted towards Game Development and its Mechanics, App and Web Development. These are some of the reasons on behalf of which I have decided that I choose Computer Engineering as my career.
